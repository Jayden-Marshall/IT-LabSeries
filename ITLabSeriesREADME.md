# My IT Lab Series Journey

Welcome to my IT Lab Series! This project is a personal documentation of my journey through setting up and managing a virtual network environment using VirtualBox and Windows Server 2016. Alongside documenting my steps, I aim to provide a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in learning the practical aspects of IT infrastructure setup and management.

## About This Series

As I navigate the complexities of IT systems, this series will cover the installation and configuration of essential IT components. From setting up virtual machines to managing Active Directory and deploying network services, each part of the series is designed to not only share my learning experiences but also to offer step-by-step guides for those who wish to replicate the process.

This series is also inspired by and directed from Kevtech IT Support, whose resources and guidance have been invaluable in shaping the content and structure of these labs. Their support has allowed me to explore and document real-world IT scenarios that are crucial for any budding IT professional.
